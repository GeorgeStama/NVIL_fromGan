## Introduction

This code implements the Neural Variational Inference and Learning (NVIL) algorithm for Sigmoid Belief Network(SBN). The NVIL was proposed by 
Andriy Mnih and Karol Gregor in their ICML paper "Neural Variational Inference and Learning in Belief Networks". Our NIPS 2015 paper 
"Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network" also uses the same algorithm, but for a different model, i.e. a SBN-based time-series model.
See the repo zhegan27/TSBN_code_NIPS2015 for details.
